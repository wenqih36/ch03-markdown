# cp

The `cp` command can be used to _copy_ a file or folder. For Example:

`cp my-photo.png my-photo2.png`

Here's some more information about the `cp` command:
* It can be used to _recursively_ copy a directory with the `-R` option: `cp -R folder-1 folder-2`
  + recursive behavior can also be invoked by `-r` or `--recursive` option
* You can print out progress to the terminal using the `-v` command, making it _verbose_: `cp -R -v folder-1 folder-2`
